Process here is to digitise the glenoid plane points on one scapular and transverse plane image each, and then map this to the other images based on aligning digitised points. The rotation/translation matrix to align the points needs to be identified and then applied to the original glenoid plane points.

The glenoid plane points are digitised as usual (i.e. mark 2 to 3 points along the estimate of the glenoid plane) in both plane images.

A set of digitised points is marked on the Latarjet screws and ExFix pins in a specific order so they can be matched.

For the scapular plane:

- Top of superior screw (centre of circular portion)
- Bottom of superior screw (most lateral aspect)
- Top of inferior screw (centre of circular portion)
- Bottom of inferior screw (most lateral aspect)
- ExFix pins from left to right of image (end of pin)

For the transverse plane:

- Top of the screw head (middle-top of head)
- End of screw (middle-bottom of screw)
- ExFix pins from left to right of image (end of pin)
