*GENERAL*

*Below currently only applies to 50% split*

S1
- Lines 3 & 4 a little tricky to distinguish on transverse plane
- Glenoid plane difficult to ID on higher abduction in transverse plane
	> Real struggle at 90 degrees of abduction
- Humerus seems to translate posteriorly as abduction increases


S2 [much more convinced with S1, and even more so S3, S4 and S5 results than S2]
- Potential shift in Ex Fix in ABER? Screws get closer to pin? Different camera view too? Camera view change isn't a huge issue unless it changes relationship between points
- Quite a lot of overlap on lines for TP images; SS1 and SS4 relatively easy to identify, SS2 & SS3 hard to distinguish though
- Humeral head a little difficult to get at in TP images (particulary ER positions); glenoid plane too
- Humeral head extremely difficult to ID on 0abd TP images

S3
- Quite good SP images; demonstrates lower SS 'kink'
- Slight movement of Ex Fix/screw points in APP [SP]?

S4
- Quite good SP images; demonstrates lower SS 'kink' particularly with 40N vs. 0N load
- Most TP OK to see, but much easier in 40N condition

S5
- Good SP images; specimen doesn't really indicate the SS 'kink' as much (or at all in some), until you get to higher abd and ER
- ***** Ex Fix and screws seem to move from 0 to 90 abd, redefined GP and pts at 90abd + multiple on TP ]see below]
- Good TP images, probably easiest TP images to see so far, gets a little tricky with ER though

S6
- Slightly strange upper SS lines on early SP images - adduction moment arm?
- SP images don't really indicate the SS 'kink' as in other specimen
- ***** Ex Fix and screws seem to move from 0 to 90 abd,  redefined GP and pts at 90abd 
- ***** Phantom out of image in ABER 0N & 40N SP, APP 0N & 40N SP --- need to use other?
- ***** Phantom could only get an estimate in 0abd 40N TP, ABER 0N TP, ABER 40N TP, APP 0N TP
- Glenoid plane hard to identify on transverse images
- Looks like some posterior translation on transverse images

S7
- New camera for S7? Different aspect ratio for SP images
- Phantom sphere seems to disappear from some images
- SS 'kink' not really obvious in SP images until ER applied
- Different camera for TP images, not as high quality
- No phantom in TP images due to small window
- Some serious posterior translation in ABER and APP in TP



*GP*
S1 - 0abd 0N SP; 0abd 0N TP
S2 - 0abd 0N SP; 90abd 40N TP [almost impossible to identify glenoid plane in TP images]
S3 - 90abd 0N SP; 90abd 0N TP
S4 - 0abd 0N SP; 90abd 0N TP
S5 - 0abd 0N SP +++ 90abd 0N SP; 0abd 0N TP +++ 90abd 0N TP +++ ABER 0N TP [see note]
S6 - 0abd 0N SP/TP +++ 90abd 0N SP +++ ABER 0N SP +++ ABER 40N SP +++ APP 0N SP
S7 - 0abd 0N SP/TP



*PHANTOMS*
S1 - not completely spherical bead of 6.5mm diameter; toroid shape with 6mm diameter
S2 - toroid with 6mm diameter? no scaling? screw length? [measurements suggest 5mm? may]
S3 - not completely spherical bead of 6.5mm diameter
S4 - not completely spherical bead of 6.5mm diameter
S5+ - perfect sphere of 7.93mm diameter


*LINES*
S2 - screw (SS1), toroid (SS2), pin (SS3), none (SS4)
S3+ - spring/cyclinder (SS1), none (SS2), big sphere (SS3), small sphere (SS4)


*COMPLETED*
*Below only for 50% split*
- S1 0N and 40N, SP and TP for every position
- S2 0N and 40N, SP and TP for 0abd, 90abd, ABER, APP (~30 mins for SP analysis; ~60 mins for TP analysis)
- S3 0N and 40N, SP and TP for 0abd, 90abd, ABER, APP
- S4 0N and 40N, SP and TP for 0abd, 90abd, ABER, APP
- S5 0N and 40N, SP and TP for 0abd, 90abd, ABER, APP
- S6 0N and 40N, SP and TP for 0abd, 90abd, ABER, APP
- S7 0N and 40N, SP and TP for 0abd, 90abd, ABER, APP [no 40N APP for TP]
