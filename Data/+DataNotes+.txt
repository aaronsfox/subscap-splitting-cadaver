*GENERAL*

*Below currently only applies to 50% split*

S1
- Lines 3 & 4 a little tricky to distinguish on transverse plane
- Glenoid plane difficult to ID on higher abduction in transverse plane
	> Real struggle at 90 degrees of abduction
- Humerus seems to translate posteriorly as abduction increases


S2 [much more convinced with S1, and even more so S3, S4 and S5 results than S2]
- Potential shift in Ex Fix in ABER? Screws get closer to pin? Different camera view too? Camera view change isn't a huge issue unless it changes relationship between points
- Quite a lot of overlap on lines for TP images; SS1 and SS4 relatively easy to identify, SS2 & SS3 hard to distinguish though
- Humeral head a little difficult to get at in TP images (particulary ER positions); glenoid plane too
- Humeral head extremely difficult to ID on 0abd TP images

S3
- Quite good SP images; demonstrates lower SS 'kink'
- Slight movement of Ex Fix/screw points in APP [SP]?

S4
- Quite good SP images; demonstrates lower SS 'kink' particularly with 40N vs. 0N load
- Most TP OK to see, but much easier in 40N condition

S5
- Good SP images; specimen doesn't really indicate the SS 'kink' as much (or at all in some), until you get to higher abd and ER
- ***** Ex Fix and screws seem to move from 0 to 90 abd, redefined GP and pts at 90abd + multiple on TP [see below]
- Good TP images, probably easiest TP images to see so far, gets a little tricky with ER though

S6
- Slightly strange upper SS lines on early SP images - adduction moment arm?
- SP images don't really indicate the SS 'kink' as in other specimen
- ***** Ex Fix and screws seem to move from 0 to 90 abd,  redefined GP and pts at 90abd 
- ***** Phantom out of image in ABER 0N, 20N & 40N SP, APP 0N, 20N & 40N SP --- need to use other?
- ***** Phantom could only get an estimate in 0abd 40N TP, ABER 0N TP, ABER 40N TP, APP 0N TP
- ***** Phantom missing on more than the above ---- what's the solution? Ratio like below? Need to digitise mini phantom?
- Glenoid plane hard to identify on transverse images
- Looks like some posterior translation on transverse images

S7
- New camera for S7? Different aspect ratio for SP images
- Phantom sphere seems to disappear from some images
- SS 'kink' not really obvious in SP images until ER applied
- Different camera for TP images, not as high quality
- No phantom in TP images due to small window
- Some serious posterior translation in ABER and APP in TP
- Worked out mini sphere size based on its size relative to larger sphere in corresponding images to set TP phantom

S8
- Listed as left but from TP images could be right?
- Seems like significant inferior subluxation in SP?

S9
- Bit of movement in camera from initial 0abd 0N to 20N, re-did GP
- Significant rotation of field of view in 90 abduction --- might this cause issues with analysis calculations as it's not the same orientation as others in SP? Was consistent with this field of view from 90abd onwards --- seems OK...
- Not easy to identify glenoid plane in TP images



*GP*
S1 - 0abd 0N SP; 0abd 0N TP [*ALL GOOD*]
S2 - 0abd 0N SP; 90abd 40N TP [*ALL GOOD*]
S3 - 90abd 0N SP; 90abd 0N TP [*ALL GOOD*]
S4 - 0abd 0N SP; 90abd 0N TP [*ALL GOOD*]
S5 - 0abd 0N SP +++ 90abd 0N SP; 0abd 0N TP +++ 90abd 0N TP +++ ABER 0N TP [see note] [*ALL GOOD*]
S6 - 0abd 0N SP/TP +++ 90abd 0N SP +++ ABER 0N SP +++ ABER 20N SP +++ ABER 40N SP +++ APP 0N SP [*ALL GOOD*]
S7 - 0abd 0N TP; all in SP as poor points available for registration/too much movement [*ALL GOOD*]
S9 - 0abd 0N SP +++ 0abd 20N SP +++ 90abd 0N SP; 0abd 0N TP [*ALL GOOD*]

***** Note on GP *****
There are some linering estimated glenoid fit data in certain folders from initial analysis runs - i.e. they were bad, the glenoid plane was re-defined for that image, but the estimation data isn't deleted. Could create a quick pipeline that deletes any of the glenoid plane estimate data if the gp.csv file is present.
